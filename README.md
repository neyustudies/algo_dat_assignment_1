Freitag, 29.05.2020 um 23:55 Uhr

## Task
• Implement the Quicksort algorithm. (40%)  
• Implement the Counting Sort algorithm. (40%)  
• Implement a main function/script that uses the algorithm with different inputs. (10%)  
• Write readable and well-commented code. (10%)  

## Tips & Suggestions

• Follow the naming conventions posted on the course webpage.  
• Turn in your work using Moodle!  
• Write elegant code!  
• Test your algorithm with borderline case inputs too!  
• Try NOT to use IDEs, but text editor + command line (Visual Studio Code would be my suggestion) for programming!  
• Please, keep the submission folder as “clean” as you can!  
• It’s fine if you have all the files together; it will make the evaluation process faster :)
